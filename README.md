convert and fix files to upper case for cp/m asm program

For now, just leave a file XYZZY.TMP on the drive.  Later after we
are happy with the code, I will have it remove the input file, and rename
the temp file back to the input file name.   But better save than sorry....
Maybe we will have xyzzy.tmp be the final destination for the input file....hmmmm
