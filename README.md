convert and fix files to upper case for cp/m asm program

NOTE:  This program reads an input file, processes it, and removes the input
file and replaces it with a new file.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you make a copy
of any file that you simply can't live without, since there is a possibility 
of error causeing the loss of your data.
